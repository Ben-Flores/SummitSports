# Summit Stash
A hybrid point of sale and marketplace application. Created for businesses to track and manage their product inventory and provide a complete shopping experience to customers.
The application was designed specifically with alpine sports gear and other similar equipment in mind, but is capable of adapting to whatever products your business requires an
inventory of. Core functionality includes sales insights for management, inventory control for employees, and browsing and ordering for consumers. The application itself offers
versatile customization of the inventory database allowing for easy installation and maintenance throughout its use.
